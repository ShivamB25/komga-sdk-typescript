---

Komga SDK is a TypeScript-first client for the Komga API. It provides a typed HTTP client, Zod validation, and domain services for common workflows.

## What you get

- Typed API calls with runtime validation
- Domain services for books, series, and libraries
- Interceptors for logging, validation, and error transforms
- Source-only ESM package with strong TypeScript support

## Choose your integration style

### Domain services (recommended)

Use high-level services that validate responses and expose friendly methods.

### Direct API functions

Call low-level endpoints directly for full API coverage and advanced use cases.

## Typical workflow

1. Create a client with `createKomgaClient`.
2. Use a domain service for common tasks.
3. Add interceptors for logging, validation, or error handling.
