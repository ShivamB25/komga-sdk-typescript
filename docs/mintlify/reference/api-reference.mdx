Komga SDK ships two complementary references:

## TypeDoc (SDK)

TypeDoc provides class and type details for the SDK itself.

- Local output: `docs/api/`
- Generate: `bun run docs`

When hosted alongside Mintlify, use the TypeDoc tab or open `/api/`.

## OpenAPI (Komga server)

The API Reference tab in this site is generated from Komga's OpenAPI spec. It stays aligned with the server API version.
